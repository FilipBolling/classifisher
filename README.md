ML classification model for images of fishes

Dataset contains 9000 labeled images of fishes, partioned into 1000 images each of different species.
The task is to analyze the dataset and train a classification model. 
The dataset is not uploaded here for size reasons, and because this was used for a job interview.

My approach is to use deep learning using keras. The notebook classifisher.ipynb contains my work process and results.

I tried two approaches: programming a straight forward CNN from scratch, and using transfer learning on MobileNetV2.

Not a conclusive solution by any means, but a fun project to do :)
